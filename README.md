:shopping: :rocket: [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) based e-commerce template for [E-Com Plus](https://www.e-com.plus) stores

## Getting started

To get started easily, you should have a **[E-Com Plus](https://www.e-com.plus)** store ([free for dev](#free-for-dev)), then deploy your new e-commerce to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Deploy to Netlify

When creating your new site on Netlify, we recommend choosing **`dist` as _branch to deploy_ with no _build settings_**.

> You can also deploy from `master` to take advantage of deploy previews, but using `dist` branch you'll consume fewer build minutes on your Netlify plan.

#### The easier way

#### The better way

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/ecomplus/storefront-starter/generate) to generate a new repository for your store;
2. Set your own E-Com Plus Store ID at `content/settings.json` and commit with message `Setup store`. **Wait up to 3 minutes** for the first build process;
3. [Log in to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and [create a _new site from Git_](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git) choosing your generated repository;
4. Select `dist` as _branch to deploy_ field and keep _basic build settings_ fields empty;
5. [Enable Netlify Identify](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui), add _invite users_ by email to administrate your storefront, you may start adding your own email address;
6. [Enable Netlify Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/#setup-and-settings);
7. To ensure Git Gateway settings, go to your Netlify site's deploys and click _trigger deply_ > _clear cache and deploy site_;

### Access CMS

Storefront comes with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for administration.

After your site is deployed, you should receive an invitation email from Netlify to grant CMS access. You must click the email link, then you should create a new password on a pop-up opened on your new e-commerce homepage.

At the end of this process you'll be able to login to CMS at `/admin/` URL using your e-mail and password.
